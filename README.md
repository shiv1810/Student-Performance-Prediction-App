# Student Performance Prediction App - iOS

## Overview

This iOS app is designed to predict student performance based on various factors and provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and analyzing student data. It utilizes Firebase and Firestore for data storage, authentication, and real-time updates. The app also incorporates a CoreML model for predictive analytics and integrates a graph library to showcase a dashboard with insightful visualizations.

## Features

- **Firebase Integration:** Utilizes Firebase for backend services, including Firestore for real-time database and Firebase Authentication for user management.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Incorporates a CoreML model to predict student performance based on input parameters.

- **Graph Library:** Integrates a graph library to visualize and showcase student performance data on a dynamic dashboard.

- **User Authentication:** Implements user authentication through Firebase Authentication to ensure secure access to the app's features.

## Requirements

- Xcode 12 or later
- Swift 5
- Firebase account and project setup
- CoreML model for predictive analytics
- Graph library (e.g., Charts, Core Plot)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-app-ios.git
   ```

2. Open the Xcode project file (`StudentPerformanceApp.xcodeproj`).

3. Install dependencies if needed.

   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

4. Set up Firebase in the project by adding the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file obtained from the Firebase console.

5. Add your CoreML model to the project.

6. Configure the graph library as per its documentation.

7. Build and run the project.

## Configuration

### Firebase Configuration

1. Set up a Firebase project: [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Add an iOS app to your Firebase project and follow the setup instructions.
3. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and add it to the Xcode project.

### CoreML Model Integration

1. Train or obtain a CoreML model for student performance prediction.
2. Add the CoreML model file to the Xcode project.

### Graph Library Configuration

1. Follow the documentation of the chosen graph library to integrate and configure it in the project.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on an iOS simulator or physical device.
2. Sign in or create a new account using Firebase Authentication.
3. Explore the dashboard to view student performance visualizations.
4. Use the input features to predict student performance using the integrated CoreML model.
